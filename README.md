## About Task

This is a github repository for a partial ticketing system. We have very simple views for a ticket index, view, and create form. You’re tasked with a few feature requests, bug fixes, a request for feedback, and to scope out a larger feature.

**Feature Requests:**
- Create a reusable utility class to format dates in Vue, implement this in the tickets index.
- Add breadcrumbs
- Pagination Improvements
  - Currently, the tickets view loads all tickets and does pagination on the client side. Let’s improve performance by implementing server-side pagination
- Advanced Search 
  - Please create a filtering system that allows us to search or filter tickets by the following fields: 
    - Title
    - Content
    - User name
    - User email
    - Date Range
    - Priority
    - Status

**Bugs:**
- [Front End] The ticket pagination isn’t working! Clicking on a page number will move me to a page, and the Prev button works, but the next button is broken.
- Ticket Submission issues 
  - Cannot create a ticket with Low or High priorities
  - Cannot create a ticket with a status of In Progress

**General:**
- If a junior developer submitted this code to you, what would your suggestions be for improvement?
**Ans:**
    - Improve the UI
    - Improve you testing skills
    - Before submission always test the application if it is working as required.
	- Always use server side pagination and vue component to evaluate server side pagination 
- This web application needs to support a mobile app via an API. Please write a short scope of what would be needed and an overview of how you would add this feature.  Provide some suggestions and options as you would if responding to this request from the project owner. The API needs to support username/password auth via a JSON api, and needs to provide CRUD for tickets.
**Ans:** 
     - The API needs to be created in Laravel which must returns the response in json format
	 - We have to keep front-end seperatly
	 - Front-end can send http requests to API and evaluate the returned json
	 - For authentication a token will be generated if logged in successfully
